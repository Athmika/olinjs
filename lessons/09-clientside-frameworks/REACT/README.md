#REACT

##So first off, what is React?

React is a Javascript library for building interfaces. So far, we’ve been using Handlebars templates to render HTML and then jQuery to make buttons make post requests and the like. We’re going to be replacing all of that hoo-ha with React, your new one-stop shop for everything your user is going to see in your application.

##Why React?

There are many, many alternatives that you guys can learn about in this class for client-side frameworks. There’s React, Ember, Angular, Backbone, and something hip and new I’m sure one of you is already “totally the master at” because it is just so “rad”. Don’t believe me? Just ask Austin, he was like this about React for literally all of last year. The point is, there are a ton of options out there.

We, as the teaching team, chose React because it fits our purposes in this course and it has become a really popular framework that is used by Facebook, Instagram, Netflix, Feedly, Airbnb, Walmart, and a ton of others. It’s lightweight, fast, easily adaptable to mobile devices, and works with Node!

That being said, we totally encourage you guys to go out and learn something new. We’ll be super-psyched to use your “totally rad” app.

##Okay, so how do we use it?
